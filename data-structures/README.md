## Linked lists

### Singly linked list

#### Singly linked list implementation

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

here is a node class with a constructor that takes a value and sets it to the value property of the node. The next property is set to null by default.
